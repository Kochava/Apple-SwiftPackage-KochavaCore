 @typedef KVATask_Closure_DidInvalidate
 
 @brief A closure which is executed when the task is invalidated.
 
 @discussion This closure can be used to invalidate secondary tasks which are part of what happens within KVATask_Closure_StartAttempt.  Note:  This closure will be called on the caller's thread to the invalidate method.  When you're expecting that call to not be on a predictable dispatch queue, it is your responsibility to provide for your own concurrency within the closure.  This may include an explicit dispatch to the globalSerial queue.
